# About Me

I am a Process Improvement Engineer (EIT) at PepsiCo Foods (Quaker) and a graduate student in Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University. My work spans operations, packaging engineering, manufacturing systems, and data-driven continuous improvement.

I focus on applying Lean/TPM principles, real-time data modeling, and cross-functional engineering practices to optimize production systems, reduce downtime, and improve plant reliability. I also lead co-ops, support capital projects, deliver SCADA dashboards, and collaborate with engineering, maintenance, and production teams.

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of:

- process optimization and reliability engineering  
- packaging systems and consumer-driven design  
- energy modeling and industrial sustainability  
- machine learning applications in manufacturing  
- SCADA and real-time operational data  
- Lean, TPM, and continuous improvement frameworks  

### Previously, I have worked on:

- TPM AM Clean & Inspect transformations  
- packaging redesigns including cost, usability, and manufacturability improvements  
- PRISM/NAC-based energy normalization models  
- plant-wide water and energy audits  
- SCADA dashboards for downtime, attainment, and SPC metrics  
- multi-million-dollar capital projects and commissioning  
- operator engagement and training initiatives
